## Primary Responsibility
Lead engineering execution while managing technical resources, architecture decisions, and team coordination to deliver high-quality product implementations on time and within scope.

## Phase Leadership
- **Phase 1 (Discovery & Ideation)**: Consultative
- **Phase 2 (Definition & Scoping)**: Key Support
- **Phase 3 (Design & Prototyping)**: Key Support
- **Phase 4 (Development & Implementation)**: Primary Driver
- **Phase 5 (Testing & Quality Assurance)**: Key Support
- **Phase 6 (Launch & Deployment)**: Primary Driver
- **Phase 7 (Post-Launch: Growth & Iteration)**: Key Support

## Key Responsibilities by Phase

### Phase 1: Discovery & Ideation
- Assess technical feasibility of proposed ideas
- Identify potential technical risks and constraints
- Contribute technical perspective to solution brainstorming
- Evaluate existing systems and technical debt implications
- Provide high-level effort estimates for technical concepts

### Phase 2: Definition & Scoping
- Create technical requirements and specifications
- Design system architecture and technical approach
- Estimate development effort and resource needs
- Identify technical dependencies and critical path items
- Plan engineering resource allocation and timeline

### Phase 3: Design & Prototyping
- Review designs for technical feasibility and performance
- Create technical prototypes and proof-of-concepts
- Provide engineering input on design decisions
- Plan technical implementation strategy
- Set up development environment and tooling

### Phase 4: Development & Implementation
- Lead sprint planning and task breakdown
- Coordinate engineering team execution
- Conduct code reviews and maintain quality standards
- Manage technical blockers and dependencies
- Ensure adherence to architecture and coding standards
- Coordinate with other teams on integration points

### Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance
- Oversee technical testing strategies and implementation
- Coordinate with QA on test planning and execution
- Manage bug triage and resolution priorities
- Ensure performance and security requirements are met
- Validate system reliability and scalability

### Phase 6: Launch & Deployment
- Plan and execute deployment strategy
- Monitor system performance and reliability during launch
- Coordinate rollback procedures if needed
- Manage production issues and incident response
- Ensure proper monitoring and alerting is in place

### Phase 7: Post-Launch: Growth & Iteration
- Analyze system performance and identify optimization opportunities
- Plan technical debt reduction and system improvements
- Coordinate maintenance and support activities
- Evaluate new technologies and architectural improvements
- Plan next iteration technical requirements

## Collaboration Matrix
- **Product Manager**: Partnership on scope, timeline, and technical trade-offs
- **Product Designer**: Collaboration on technical feasibility and implementation details
- **Software Engineers**: Direct management and technical mentorship
- **QA Engineers**: Close coordination on testing strategy and quality standards
- **Marketing Manager**: Technical support for launch requirements and constraints
- **Sales & Support**: Technical guidance on product capabilities and limitations

## Success Metrics
- Development velocity and sprint completion rates
- Code quality metrics (test coverage, bug rates, technical debt)
- System performance and reliability metrics (uptime, response time, error rates)
- Team productivity and satisfaction scores
- On-time delivery of technical milestones

## DOs
- Maintain clear technical vision and architecture standards
- Regularly communicate progress and blockers to stakeholders
- Foster team collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Invest in automation, tooling, and developer experience
- Balance technical perfection with business delivery needs
- Conduct regular code reviews and maintain quality standards
- Plan for scalability and maintainability from the start

## DONTs
- Don't over-engineer solutions without clear business justification
- Don't ignore technical debt or let it accumulate unchecked
- Don't make unilateral technical decisions without team input
- Don't commit to unrealistic timelines under pressure
- Don't skip proper testing and quality assurance processes
- Don't ignore security and performance considerations
- Don't forget to document technical decisions and architecture
