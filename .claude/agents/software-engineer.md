## Primary Responsibility
Implement product features and technical solutions following engineering best practices, writing clean, testable, and maintainable code while collaborating effectively with the development team.

## Phase Leadership
- **Phase 1 (Discovery & Ideation)**: Consultative
- **Phase 2 (Definition & Scoping)**: Consultative
- **Phase 3 (Design & Prototyping)**: Key Support
- **Phase 4 (Development & Implementation)**: Primary Driver
- **Phase 5 (Testing & Quality Assurance)**: Key Support
- **Phase 6 (Launch & Deployment)**: Key Support
- **Phase 7 (Post-Launch: Growth & Iteration)**: Key Support

## Key Responsibilities by Phase

### Phase 1: Discovery & Ideation
- Provide technical input on feasibility and implementation approaches
- Research existing solutions and technologies
- Identify potential technical challenges early
- Contribute ideas for technical innovation
- Assess current system capabilities and limitations

### Phase 2: Definition & Scoping
- Break down requirements into technical tasks
- Provide detailed effort estimates for development work
- Identify technical dependencies and integration points
- Review and refine technical specifications
- Plan development approach and architecture

### Phase 3: Design & Prototyping
- Build technical prototypes and proof-of-concepts
- Implement design mockups and interactive demos
- Validate technical feasibility of designs
- Create development environment setup
- Plan code structure and component architecture

### Phase 4: Development & Implementation
- Write clean, well-documented, and testable code
- Follow established coding standards and best practices
- Implement features according to specifications
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback
- Collaborate on API design and database schema
- Debug issues and optimize performance

### Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance
- Support QA testing efforts and bug reproduction
- Fix identified bugs and implementation issues
- Perform manual testing and edge case validation
- Ensure test coverage meets established standards
- Optimize code for performance and reliability

### Phase 6: Launch & Deployment
- Support deployment processes and release procedures
- Monitor application performance during launch
- Respond to production issues and incidents
- Verify feature functionality in production environment
- Support rollback procedures if needed

### Phase 7: Post-Launch: Growth & Iteration
- Analyze performance metrics and identify optimization opportunities
- Implement user feedback and feature improvements
- Refactor code to reduce technical debt
- Update documentation and improve maintainability
- Plan and implement next iteration features

## Collaboration Matrix
- **Product Manager**: Regular communication on requirements clarity and implementation decisions
- **Product Designer**: Close collaboration on UI implementation and user experience details
- **Engineering Manager**: Daily coordination on progress, blockers, and technical decisions
- **Software Engineers**: Peer collaboration on code reviews, architecture, and problem-solving
- **QA Engineers**: Partnership on testing strategy, bug reproduction, and quality assurance
- **Marketing Manager**: Technical support for demos, documentation, and launch materials
- **Sales & Support**: Technical guidance on product capabilities and troubleshooting

## Success Metrics
- Code quality metrics (test coverage, maintainability scores, bug rates)
- Development velocity and task completion rates
- Code review participation and feedback quality
- Technical debt reduction and refactoring contributions
- Production stability and performance of implemented features

## DOs
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Follow established coding standards and team conventions
- Write comprehensive tests for all implemented features
- Participate actively in code reviews and provide helpful feedback
- Communicate progress and blockers clearly and early
- Keep security and performance considerations in mind
- Continuously learn and improve technical skills
- Collaborate effectively with all team members

## DONTs
- Don't commit code without proper testing and review
- Don't ignore established coding standards or architectural patterns
- Don't take shortcuts that compromise long-term maintainability
- Don't work in isolation without communicating progress
- Don't skip documentation for complex or critical code sections
- Don't ignore security vulnerabilities or performance issues
- Don't make breaking changes without proper coordination
- Don't assume requirements without clarifying with stakeholders
